# structural bioinformatics in python
A light-weighted python library for parsing 3D-coordinates files of Biomolecules, enable the direct access the properties of 3D-coordinates files in python at different levels, i.e., atomic, residue, molecular.   
SBio python can directly load 3D coordinates files, such as PDB, mol2 and automatically parsing their content. Manipulation the properties of 3D coordinates file are possible in SBio python. Coordinates, labels and other property can be easilt accessed and updates. Geometry-based methods are provided, such as distance, angle and dihedral analysis, structural alignment, can be further used to extract informations in the 3D-coordinates files.

# structural bioinformatics in python
A light-weighted python library for parsing 3D-coordinates files of Biomolecules, provides the direct access the properties of 3D-coordinates files in python at different levels, i.e., atomic, residue, molecule.   
SBio python can directly load 3D coordinates files, such as PDB, mol2 and automatically parsing their content. Manipulation the properties of 3D coordinates file are possible in SBio python. Coordinates, labels and other property can be easily accessed and updated. Geometry-based methods are provided, such as measurement of distance, angle and dihedral, analysis of hydrogen bond and polar interaction, structural alignment, can be further used to extract information in the 3D-coordinates files.
